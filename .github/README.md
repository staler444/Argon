# Argon simulation
## Project's goals
    1. Simulate cluster of Argon's atoms, using molecular mechanic
    2. Study how various optimalisations influance performance and correctnes of computations.
    3. Come up with most eficience ways to implement computations in varius use cases (diffrent configurations of simulation, diffrent target machines etc.)
